DevKit Custom Layouts - Create amazing custom layouts and insert them into your theme using simple hooks.

== Description ==

Originally inspired by Astra's custom layouts module, DevKit Custom layouts aims to bring that same type of editing power to any WordPress site, regardless of which theme is used. Out of the box Astra, Genesis, & Divi are supported, and more default theme support will be added in future releases. Additionally, any theme can add theme support with a few simple filters. If your theme isn't supported or you don't want to add it, use our simple shortcode instead. Build an entire custom website with minimal coding knowledge, and maximum control!

Bring your own editor!

DevKit Custom Layouts supports the native block editor, as well as popular page builders such as Beaver Builder and Elementor. Create a layout with your choice of editor and insert wherever you want based on a powerful conditions engine.

- Display/Hide on entire site
- Display/Hide only on certain post types
- Display/Hide only on select pages, posts, categories, etc.
- Display/Hide only after/before a certain date
- Display/Hide on custom conditions defined by you!
- From simple to complex, you have full control of what is displayed when and where.

In addition to creating custom layouts in the editor or your choosing, DevKit Custom Layouts also includes a raw code editor for inserting JS, CSS, or any type of markup using the Twig templating engine and supported by Timber.

Further, DevKit Custom Layouts includes a growing list of out-of-the-box ready template parts. These can be used directly, enhanced, or easily overridden by including a template-part in your theme. These include:

- An Author Box for displaying post authors on your blog
- Related Posts Grid from Contextual Related Posts (if installed)
- Related Posts List from Contextual Related Posts (if installed)
- Related Posts Grid from Jetpack (if installed)
- Social Sharing from Social Warfare (if installed)
- Social Sharing from Jetpack (if installed)
- Breadcrumbs from Yoast (if installed)
- Breadcrumbs from NavXT (if installed)

Start enhancing your site the easy way!
